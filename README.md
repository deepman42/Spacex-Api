*INTRODUCTION

A simple fetching from the Spacex API  and doing a map of it, then print the data.
ItÂ´s a very simple exercise but it looks very good as finished.
I used React for the app and Javascript for logics.

*REQUERIMENTS.

-Create React App.
-NPM commands for use the app(NO YARN).

*INSTALLATION

I personally recommend use a git clone from the repository for take the app.

but if you wnat install the react app by your self there is their own documentation.
